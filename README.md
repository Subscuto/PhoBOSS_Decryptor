## PhoBOSS_Decryptor
* The source code of the decryptor can be found in the "Decryptor" subfolder
* The "Supporting_materials" subfolder contains samples ("7.za.exe...." and "processhacker...") to test the functionality of the decryptor. These are legit, uninfected executables.  
* For decryption, the test files should be copied next to the .exe.
* The scripts located in the "Support_materials" folder were used during the attack to delete logs and shadow copies
